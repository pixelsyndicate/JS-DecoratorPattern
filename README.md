# JS-DecoratorPattern
Demonstrating the Decorator Pattern (aka Wrapper) using Javascript and Html

# What This Demonstrates
This project demonstrates the Decorator Pattern.

By extending functionality to existing classes, we uphold the S<b>O</b>LiD principle of <b>O</b>pen for Extension/Closed for modification.

By not using inheritance (IS-A) and using wrappers for the base (HAS-A) we can provide new functionality while retaining the original code.

# How To Use This

open the 'Index.html' file in your browser, or open the containing folder with a product like Brackets.Io and run it.

Functionality is demonstrated via button click events. Functionality demonstrated by adding price increases to a integer field in the baseclass, and entending the baseclass name with each wrapper implimented.
